# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the landing-page information hierarchy, enrich the portfolio with provided imagery, and refresh leadership/positioning copy across key sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Reorder the landing page so the About section appears above Selected Work, and update the header navigation so “About” is the first nav item with smooth-scroll behavior preserved for all sections.
- Add images from the provided portfolio file into relevant landing-page areas (e.g., Selected Work thumbnails) and case study pages as static frontend assets, including appropriate alt text and responsive layout handling.
- Slightly reword and integrate the provided “strategic architect / product leadership” themes into high-impact site copy (e.g., hero subhead/description, value propositions, and/or About) in English, aligned with the existing modern/minimal tone.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see About first (and can navigate to it via the first header tab), view richer project thumbnails and case-study visuals sourced from the portfolio images, and read updated leadership positioning language consistently across the site.
