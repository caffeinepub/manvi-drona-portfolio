  "summary": "REQ-7 appears implemented by reordering the LandingPage sections and updating the desktop header nav so About is first with smooth scrolling. REQ-8 is partially implemented by referencing portfolio image paths in projects/caseStudies content and rendering them on case study pages with alt text/captions, but the diff shows no added static image assets themselves. REQ-9 appears implemented via updated leadership positioning copy in siteContent.json and its use in Hero/About sections.",
